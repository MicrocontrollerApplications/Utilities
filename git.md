# Git
Git is nowadays probably the most common Version Control System for Software Development. Version Control is mainly used to create a development history 
during development. This reduces the potential of data loss and enables one to easily reset changes. Furthermore, in professional software development teams 
Version Control can be used to review the work of colleagues to improve code quality and reduce the potential for bugs.

Within this lecture we will not actively use Git, but GitHub to provdie you with the relevant code for your laboratory sessions.
Therefore, mainly one feature of Git is necessary - cloning a repository. Those who want to know more about Git, should take a look at the [references](#references)

## Git Clone
If not stated otherwise within the repositories README, cloning a git repository is always the same and requires the below 4 steps.
### 1. Get the repositories link (in our case from GitHub)

### 2. Open the Git bash

### 3. Navigate to the folder you want to clone your repository into

### 4. Clone the repository :)
